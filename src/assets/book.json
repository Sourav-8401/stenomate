    "e3" : "I am thankful to you for having given me this opportunity long last to say a few words on the Budget. Already, much has been said and I think the Finance Minister has come in for his share of congratulations as well as criticisms. So, there is not very much to say but I should like to say a few words. The increased development expenditure and the absence of any new taxation has earned for the Budget a good response even from the businessmen. I specially welcome the relief given to the middle classes by raising the exemption limit of (100) income-tax in respect of personal income. No doubt, this is some relief to the middle classes. But I would request the Finance Minister, if he could, to raise this exemption limit from Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 6,000 as that would give substantial relief to the middle classes. I am indeed glad that the Taxation Enquiry Commission has been appointed with Dr. John Mathai as the Chairman, and I am sure that many of the vexed problems may be solved through this Commission.",
