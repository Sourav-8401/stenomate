    "e3" : "I am thankful to you for having given me this long-awaited opportunity to say a few words on the Budget. Much has already been said, and I think the Finance Minister has received his share of both congratulations and criticisms. So, there is not much left to add, but I would like to make a few remarks.The increased development expenditure and the absence of any new taxation have earned the Budget a positive response, even from the business community. I especially welcome the relief given to the middle class by raising the exemption limit for income tax on personal income. No doubt, this provides some relief to the middle class. However, I would request the Finance Minister, if possible, to raise this exemption limit from Rs. 4,000 to Rs. 6,000, as that would offer substantial relief. I am indeed glad that the Taxation Enquiry Commission has been appointed with Dr. John Mathai as the Chairman, and I am sure that many of the vexed problems may be solved through this Commission. At the same time, I would request the Finance Minister to put off the Estate Duty Bill for the present since this Enquiry Commission has been appointed and they may go into this question. For, I feel that it is not an opportune moment to put on more taxes on the people. Already, as Mr. Gadgil has pointed out, there are so many taxes, and they are just trying to recover their stability. So, in regard to Estate Duty, I would ask him to consider it. My reason for asking it to be postponed is, as I have said, that the people are still facing economic distress. And then, our Government is not able to offer the amenities that other countries have, where the Estate Duty exists, such as free compulsory education for children, free medical aid, homes for the poor and the destitute, old age pension, etc. So, my humble suggestion is that this point may be considered by the Taxation Enquiry Commission. I agree that there is a brighter side of the picture and that instead of continually harping on our poverty, we should also see the bright side. We are making encouraging progress towards laying the foundation of a welfare state. With the cooperation of all and the implementation of the Five-Year Plan, I am sure, Sir, that we should be able to lay the foundations and fulfill the dreams of India. It is indeed encouraging to know from the Finance Minister that there is a tendency of lowering food prices all over the world, and in that case, the prices in our country too would be lowered. Regarding Defence, for obvious security reasons, I do not agree with my friends who say that the expenditure should be curtailed. It is not advisable to take any undue risks and slacken the defence arrangements. Indeed, defence is one of our valuable assets although, strange to say, there seems to be adverse opinions in some quarters. I agree with what General Cariappa once said, that God and the Army are remembered only when there is trouble. The Army consists of the most disciplined and loyal set of young men. It would not be proper to effect the economy in the pay of these brave officers, as it would not be an incentive for the right type of young men to join the Army, and it would become ineffective and inefficient. I believe already officers who were drawing Rs. 1,400 as their pay are now getting only Rs. 700 and about Rs. 100 as an allowance. That is, they are getting about half of what they were getting before. It is very hard for those officers on field duty to establish separate establishments for their families and for their children, and I would specially appeal to the Finance Minister to see that the family allowances may be restored to those officers who are on field duty. Economy in the Army could be effected in other ways. There is scope for a more efficient operation of defence industries, which seems slow, and by a purchase policy of utilizing goods and stores indigenously manufactured. Preference should be given to country-made war materials such as could be produced here, and they would be cheaper than foreign-made goods. I may also suggest that the Armed Forces who are not on field service or under any operational commitments could be utilized for giving military training to the youths in schools and colleges, which would teach discipline and loyalty. The university authorities should make military training a part of their compulsory education, just as they have adopted social, domestic, and political sciences. The National Cadet Corps is already inculcating military training in some universities such as Bombay and Calcutta. But if military training is made compulsory for our university students, it will go a long way.",
